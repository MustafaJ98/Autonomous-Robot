# Lab 4 Navigation

Objective: 
1. Work with your partner to understand the requirements of this lab, and come up with a high-level design for the `turnTo()` and the `travelTo()` methods.
2. Add code to make your logic control the robot.
3. Using the `Navigation` methods you implemented, write a program to travel through a set of waypoints.
4. Adjust the parameters of your controller, if any, to minimize the distance between the desired destination and the final position of the robot.
   Simultaneously, you should aim to minimize the number of oscillations made by the robot around its destination before stopping.

# Autonomous-Robot
This repo contains code for [Lego Mindstorms EV3 kit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lego_Mindstorms_EV3) used in the course [ECSE-211](https://www.mcgill.ca/study/2021-2022/courses/ecse-211) (Design Principles and Methods).

The EV3 has an ARM9 CPU running Linux. Programs are written in Java using the LeJOS plugin. A Java Virtual Machine (JVM) running on the Linux allows to run the java program on the EV3 brick.

In the course, we explore the following concepts regarding design, robotics and hardware constraints:

1) Lab 1 Wall Follower: Sensors and feedback controllers.
2) Lab 2 Odometry: measure robotâ€™s position and orientation, allowing it to autonomously navigate a field.
3) Lab 3 Localization: localize the robot using ultrasonic and light sensors.
4) Lab 4 Navigation: allows the robot to drive to a destination through a specified set of waypoints.
5) Lab 5 Color Detection: calibrate and optimize the color sensor for determining the color of a ring without physical contact. 
6) Final Project: Search and Rescue Vehicle.

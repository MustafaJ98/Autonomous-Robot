# ECSE211 Lab 2
Objective: Design and implement an Odometry system that provides a robot’s position and orientation, allowing it to autonomously navigate a field.

This lab was aimed at basic physics and odometry techniques to implement an odometer.

We performed calculations on tire widths, wheelbase, tires' differential motion, and rotational motion to determine the robot's distance and orientations.

For details on the design process, implementation and testing, please review the report attached.

# Lab 5 Color Detection

Objective:
1. Charcterize your three ultrasonic and color sensors, and select the best ones. Document this process for the project.
2. Test your software design by running your logic (as helper methods) on your computer, if you are doing any complex computations. 
3. Gradually integrate your software features into the codebase, making sure to validate them before and after they are introduced.
   If your hardware changes, adjust your software as needed.
4. Test your robot with the different demo scenarios mentioned in step 1. Don't forget to test edge cases.

We obtained raw RGB data from the color sensor on different colors.
We then performed statistical analysis on the data to find the best values of mean and standard deviation for each color and then optimize and calibrate the sensor to give final verdict on each color. 


For details on the design process, implementation and testing, please review the report attached.

# ECSE211 Lab 1
Objective: Design and implement a wall following system that can navigate around a sequence of blocks and obstacles that form a wall containing gaps, concave corners, and convex corners 

This lab was aimed at understanding the EC3 brick and using ultrasonic sensor to implement navigation and feedback control.
The ultrasonic sensor listens for echos to determine its distance from a wall and correct its path.

Two of the controllers implemented were:
- Bang Bang Controller: is a feedback controller that switches abruptly between two states.
- P-type Controller: accounts for the size of error and makes correction proportional to the error.

For details on the design process, implementation and testing, please review the report attached.
